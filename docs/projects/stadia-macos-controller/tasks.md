# Stadia macOS Controller

## Goal
Build a reliable local macOS controller bridge that maps Stadia button presses to actions, with automatic profile switching by frontmost app and a strong Phase 1 profile for Ghostty.

## Why / Impact
Using the Stadia controller as a shortcut pad reduces keyboard context switching and supports a dictation-first workflow where button taps trigger common editing, terminal, and voice-assist actions.
Primary beneficiary is day-to-day development in Ghostty; secondary value is reusable per-app profiles for later expansion.
If implemented poorly, global hotkeys could fire in the wrong app and disrupt active work.

## Context
The Stadia controller is detected on this macOS machine via USB (`18d1:9400`) and appears in Apple GameController APIs as an extended gamepad profile.
This repo now contains a working Swift bridge (`src/main.swift`), launchd installers, and live mappings in `config/mappings.json`.
The desired behavior is profile-based: when the frontmost app changes, action mappings should switch automatically.
Phase 1 uses explicit profile mapping only (`ghostty` now; more app profiles later). If an app is not mapped, no action should fire.
The user often dictates commands/prompts, so button mappings should prioritize quick tap/hold actions that complement voice input.
Ghostty global startup behavior (Codex first, then fallback shell) is intentionally machine-level and lives in `~/GitHub/scripts/setup/codex/ghostty-codex-then-shell.sh` on both machines.

## Decisions
Use Swift + Apple `GameController` for controller input capture.
Use Apple AppKit/Accessibility APIs for frontmost-app awareness and action execution so behavior remains native on macOS.
Implement a single source-of-truth config layer for profile mappings (not hardcoded in multiple places).
Start with one concrete profile: `ghostty` (no global fallback profile).
Support edge-trigger (press once), hold-repeat (optional), and debounce controls per mapping.
Keep Ghostty global behavior and machine bootstrap logic in `~/GitHub/scripts`; keep controller profile/mapping logic in this repo.

## Open Questions
- None currently.

## Tasks
- [x] Scaffold Swift CLI app in `src/` with controller connection/disconnection logging and per-button event logging.
- [x] Add input event normalization layer (`button`, `state`, `timestamp`, `repeat`) so mapping logic is controller-model agnostic.
- [x] Build profile resolver that tracks frontmost app bundle identifier and selects active mapped profile (`ghostty`).
- [x] Implement mapping engine with per-action debounce, edge-trigger semantics, and optional hold behavior.
- [x] Implement action executors for: keyboard shortcuts, shell commands, and optional AppleScript commands.
- [x] Add config loader with schema validation for profile mappings in `config/mappings.json`.
- [x] Add config file watcher for hot-reload updates without restarting the bridge.
- [x] Define initial Ghostty profile for high-frequency actions (tab navigation, split/nav, command palette, etc.).
- [x] Add global safety controls: dry-run mode, per-profile enable/disable, and emergency toggle/hotkey.
- [x] Add startup/run scripts and setup notes for required permissions (Accessibility/Input Monitoring if required).
- [x] Validate end-to-end: focus Ghostty, press mapped buttons, verify expected action fires only once per press.
- [x] Validate behavior when frontmost app has no profile (bridge skips actions, no unexpected global action).
- [x] Install and validate `launchd` service on both machines using repo-local installer.
- [x] Add canonical machine-ops wrappers in `~/GitHub/scripts/setup/` so launchd install/uninstall is consolidated for both machines.
- [x] Grant Accessibility permission on second machine for staged bridge executable path (`~/Library/Application Support/stadia-controller-bridge/StadiaControllerBridge.app/Contents/MacOS/stadia-controller-bridge`).
- [x] Resolve MacBook `leftThumbstickButton` stale runtime mapping and verify it emits `keyCode=2` (split down) in live logs.
- [x] Standardize launchd label + signing identifier + staged runtime path across both machines to avoid per-machine identity drift.
- [x] Add a one-command launchd verifier script and document canonical machine-level verify usage.
- [x] Move machine-level Stadia wrappers to nested `~/GitHub/scripts/setup/stadia/` as the single canonical path (no compatibility aliases).
- [x] Simplify Ghostty control layout: `L1` tabs, `R1` split cycle, D-pad Up/Down for model picker, reserve D-pad Left/Right.
- [x] Map `X` to Ghostty split zoom toggle (maximize/restore focused split) for quick reversible focus.
- [ ] Capture Phase 2 backlog for Codex-specific profile behavior after Ghostty flow is stable.
- [x] Review `AGENTS.md` and update if new repeatable implementation patterns were introduced (stable cross-machine service identity/path now documented).
- [ ] Archive project notes to `docs/projects/archive/stadia-macos-controller/` when the user confirms completion.

## Validation / Test Plan
Run bridge locally with Stadia controller connected.
Open Ghostty and verify mapped button behavior for core flows (navigation, tab movement, command triggers).
Move focus to a non-profiled app and verify no Ghostty-specific action leaks.
Verify debounce prevents accidental double-fire during quick taps.
Verify emergency toggle immediately suppresses all mapped actions.
Run in dry-run mode first to inspect resolved profile + action logs before enabling real key/command execution.

## Next 3 Actions
1. Capture Phase 2 backlog for Codex-specific profile behavior now that Ghostty flow is stable.
2. Archive project notes to `docs/projects/archive/stadia-macos-controller/` once user confirms project completion.
3. Keep troubleshooting notes in `docs/references/setup.md` and `docs/references/deployment.md` current when recovery steps change.
